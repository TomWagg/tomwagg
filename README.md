### Hello there!

I'm Tom Wagg, an astrophysics PhD student at the University of Washington. I love all sorts of astrophysics, particularly anything involving binaries and massive stars, and I'm very enthusiastic to share all of the code I use in my research on GitHub!

I'm currently working on **creating self-consistent population synthesis and galactic dynamics simulations** to make predictions for the Milky Way and nearby galaxies ([cogsworth](https://www.github.com/TomWagg/cogsworth) coming soon!) but I've previously worked with Eric Agol on constraining the planetary radius valley, with Mario JuriÄ‡ on making predictions for NEO follow-up during LSST and with Selma de Mink on gravitational waves and predictions for Galactic sources in the LISA mission.

I've also contributed to several astrophysics codes. I've released a python package called [LEGWORK](https://www.github.com/TeamLEGWORK/LEGWORK) with Katie Breivik to make everyone's life easier when working with stellar-origin binaries in LISA and doing the legwork for you. I also use and enjoy helping with the development of the rapid binary population synthesis code [COMPAS](https://www.github.com/TeamCOMPAS/COMPAS) and have contributed to [COSMIC](https://www.github.com/COSMIC-popsynth/COSMIC) and [Gala](https://www.github.com/adrn/gala) as well.
