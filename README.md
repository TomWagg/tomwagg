### Hello there!

I'm Tom Wagg, an astrophysics PhD student at the University of Washington. I'm still not sure what my favourite facet of astrophysics is but I _do_ know that I'm enthusiastic to share all of the code I use in my research on GitHub!

I'm currently working with Mario JuriÄ‡ on making predictions for LSST but I've previously worked with Selma de Mink on gravitational waves. In particular, I focussed on LISA and trying to predict the LISA detectable Galactic population of double compact objects. You can find out more in my [repository for this project](https://github.com/TomWagg/detecting-DCOs-in-LISA)

I've also contributed to several astrophysics codes. I recently released a python package called [LEGWORK](https://www.github.com/TeamLEGWORK/LEGWORK) with [Katie Breivik](https://www.github.com/KatieBreivik) to make everyone's life easier when working with stellar-origin binaries in LISA and doing the legwork for you. I also use and enjoy helping with the development of the rapid binary population synthesis code [COMPAS](https://www.github.com/TeamCOMPAS/COMPAS).
